# Path of Exile User Scripts

This project hosts a few user scripts which can enhance Path of Exile's community content.

User scripts are small pieces of JavaScript code which run in a browser extension and manipulate whichever webpages they target.

If you know what you are doing then you can use the links below to install the scripts...if not, read on:
